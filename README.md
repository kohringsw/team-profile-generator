# Team Profile Generator

![README Generator Screenshot](assets/team-profile-generator.png)

## Description
This is an application that generates an online portfolio containing profiles for employees based on user input. Using npm inquirer, the user is prompted to answer questions that will create a profile for each employee of their team. These questions include prompts for name, employee ID, email address (using email-validator) and then a choice of Manager, Engineer or Intern. When Manager is selected, then the user is asked for their office number. When Engineer is selected then the usuer is asked for their GitHub username. When Intern is selected then the user is asked for their school. The user is then asked if they would like to continue adding profiles to their team. If they do, the questions start over at the beginning. If they do not, an index.html file is created and the portfolio is generated.
